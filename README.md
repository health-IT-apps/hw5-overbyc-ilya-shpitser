# HW5-Group-Assignment

## Team Members

1. Casey Overby Taylor (overbyc)
2. Ilya Shpitser (ilya-shpitser)

## Project Name

This is an example repository for your homework 5 submission.
(Put your a brief description of your interactive chart and your dataset here.)

## Access and Running Instructions

Create a [Github Organization Project Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages) to describe and link to your online interactive chart. Also, put your running instructions here. (Tell us how to run your interactive chart.) For example:

"Access our visualization at http://health-IT-apps.github.io/HW5-Group-Assignment-overbyc-ilya-shpitser/ or download this repository and run `python controller.py` and access this from http://127.0.0.1:5000/."

At the top of the GitHub project, replace the one-line description (i.e., replace "Example repository for HW 5 group assignment submission")

At the top of the GitHub project, replace the link to your final work so people can access it directly from the CS.601.265 GitHub page (i.e., replace "http://health-IT-apps.github.io/HW5-Group-Assignment-overbyc-ilya-shpitser/").

## Story Board

Put either your storyboard content or a link to your storyboard image here. You can take a picture of a hand drawn storyboard, or use any software to create one.

### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

A paragraph explaining changes between the storyboard and the final implementation.

- Breakdown of how the work was split among the group members.
